Build Rust Backend Core for Extensible Accounting System Context

A company needs a robust, extensible backend system built in Rust that will serve as the foundation for future accounting automation features. Rather than implementing all functional requirements immediately, the priority is to establish a solid, maintainable core architecture that will allow for seamless addition of modules without disrupting the system.

Core System Components to Implement

1. API Gateway
   * Central entry point for all external requests
   * Request routing and validation logic
   * Rate limiting and throttling implementation
   * Extensible middleware system for future enhancements
   * Logging and request tracing capabilities

2. Authentication & Authorization
   * Role-based access control framework
   * API token management system
   * Integration capabilities with existing authentication systems
   * Configurable permission models
   * Audit logging for security events

3. Common Services Layer
   * Reusable service components for future modules
   * Notification delivery infrastructure (Slack, email)
   * Scheduling and job execution framework
   * Data transformation and processing utilities
   * Error handling and reporting services

4. Data Storage Abstraction
   * Database connection management
   * Query builders and ORM functionality
   * Support for multiple database types (relational, time series)
   * Connection pooling and optimization
   * Data migration utilities

5. Event Bus / Message Queue
   * Publish-subscribe pattern implementation
   * Inter-service communication framework
   * Asynchronous task processing
   * Retry mechanisms and dead letter queues
   * Event sourcing capabilities

Technical Requirements
* Build the backend in Rust for reliability and performance
* Implement asynchronous programming using tokio ecosystem
* Design with a hexagonal/ports and adapters architecture for flexibility
* Create comprehensive unit and integration tests for the core
* Ensure proper error handling throughout the system
* Implement thorough logging and observability features
* Design for containerization and cloud deployment
* Document all core APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger
* Build with security as a foundational principle
* Leverage existing Rust crates whenever possible instead of implementing functionality from scratch
* Keep the entire core system as a single crate for simplicity and maintainability

Implementation Notes
* The functional modules (Financial Alerts, Revenue Automation, etc.) are NOT part of this initial implementation
* The core architecture should be designed specifically to make it easy to add these modules in the future
* Focus on building extensible interfaces that future modules can implement
* Ensure the core can run independently and remain stable as modules are added or modified
* Prioritize clean API design and separation of concerns

Deliverables
* Complete Rust codebase for the core system components
* Architectural documentation and diagrams
* API documentation for core services
* Testing suite covering the core functionality
* Deployment configuration for containerized environments
* Developer guide for adding new modules to the system

Build this backend core with maintainability, extensibility, and reliability as the primary concerns. The architecture should make it straightforward to implement the functional requirements as separate modules in future phases without modifying or disrupting the core system.
