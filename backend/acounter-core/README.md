This system will reduce the workload for personnel by auto-filling timesheets with a standard 8 hours. 
It provides users with a template where they only need to report exceptions. The system will also notify users if they haven't approved their work hours, preventing delays in sending the information to the salary handler.
It allows for natural interaction and only requires a daily check-off. For instance, a user could simply select "Normal Workday," and their time would be logged automatically. If they were absent for an hour, they would report that specific deviation.
Overall, the system aims to simplify time reporting for everyone in the company who uses the Fortnox system. 
This will also allow Ida to focus on other tasks, as she will no longer be needed to fix routine scheduling problems; these can be handled automatically by the system. 
However, if rules are broken and the system cannot automatically resolve the issue, both the person involved and Ida will be notified.

I've asked around the office and found that this would provide an experience of much higher quality compared to the current fortnox workflow.
